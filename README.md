# IPFP in Python

`ipfp_python` contains Python implementations of the Iterative
Projection Fitting Procedure (IPFP) algorithm to solve for equilibrium, 
do comparative statics, and estimate the parameters in several separable matching models 
of the 
[Choo and Siow 2006](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/498585?seq=1) variety. 

This class of matching models is one-to-one, bipartite, separable 
with perfectly transferable
utilities---see [Galichon and Salanié 2020](https://econ.columbia.edu/working-paper/cupids-invisible-hand-social-surplus-and-identification-in-matching-models-2/)
for a general study.

I also created a [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) app that demonstrates the basic Choo and Siow model. You can find a (hopefully) working version of the  app  [here](http://18.223.22.194:8501).

Please see the [html docs](docs/build/html/index.html)  or the [pdf manual](docs/build/latex/ipfp_python.pdf) for more information.

This package is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt). I hope it is useful to you.
